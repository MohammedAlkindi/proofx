ProofX is a research toolkit for directed counterexample search in discrete and
analytic number theory. It currently focuses on Collatz, Goldbach, and Riemann
Hypothesis-adjacent numerical experiments. The project is deliberately framed as
search and evidence tooling, not as a proof system.

The central rule is simple: when a run finds no counterexample, the result is
reported as **unrefuted at this budget**. That does not mean true, verified,
validated, likely, or proved. It only means that the configured search did not
find a disproof.

## Current Scope

ProofX contains three kinds of material:

| Area | Status | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/python/codebase/` | Active Python research toolkit | Runs directed searches, computes features, writes ledgers, and exposes the CLI. |
| `ProofX/` | Root Lean 4 certificate layer | Checks small bounded artifacts and status semantics. |
| `docs/` | Maintainer and research documentation | Describes assumptions, algorithms, run semantics, and limitations. |
| `src/` | Static research site | Presents the project, demos, and result summaries without changing the engine behavior. |
| `packages/germinal/` | Vendored sibling project | Separate Lean 4 conjecture-generation and proof-attempt system, synced by subtree. |

`packages/germinal/` has its own README and operating rules. Keep ProofX-root
changes separate from Germinal changes unless a task explicitly crosses that
boundary.

## What ProofX Does Not Claim

ProofX does not prove Collatz, Goldbach, the Riemann Hypothesis, or any related
open conjecture.

ProofX does not certify mathematical truth from empirical runs.

ProofX does not treat high near-miss scores as probabilities of falsehood. A
score ranks candidates inside this toolkit's search strategy; it is not a
calibrated belief.

ProofX does not make benchmark claims unless a run ledger, command, hardware
context, and version information are provided.

## Directed Search

Uniform scans are useful for bounded verification, but they are not what this
repository is mainly testing. ProofX asks a narrower question: if a
counterexample existed, what structural signals might make a candidate worth
checking first?

Current strategies:

| Engine | Search idea | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collatz | Expand from known high stopping-time anchors and score trajectories by growth, parity, entropy, and excursion features. | Candidate ledger with convergence diagnostics and near-miss scores. |
| Goldbach | Search structurally sparse even numbers whose observed partition count is low relative to Hardy-Littlewood prediction. | Candidate ledger with partition counts, deficits, and residue-family metadata. |
| Riemann | Compute numerical signals from zeta zeros and Keiper-Li coefficients. | Numerical diagnostics only; not a proof of RH or a certified zero computation. |

The shared FalsificationEngine writes every evaluated candidate to JSONL. The
ledger is the audit trail: it records candidate, conjecture label, strategy,
feature vector, score, details, timestamp, and RNG seed.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the fuller maintainer map.

Local caches, virtual environments, generated run outputs, and old root-level
scratch folders are intentionally ignored. On Windows, run
`scripts/cleanup.ps1 -Deep`; on Unix shells, run `./scripts/cleanup.sh --deep`.
Do not move the old Germinal tree back to the root: it belongs under
`packages/germinal/`.

## Lean 4 Boundary

The root Lean package checks bounded certificates produced by the search, not
hand-written samples. `python -m codebase.cli export lean` reads the ledger and
writes one named theorem per certifiable row into
`ProofX/Generated/LedgerCertificates.lean`:

```lean
theorem collatz_27_reaches_one :
    reachesOneWithin 111 27 = true := by
  decide

theorem goldbach_28_has_pair :
    goldbachPair 28 5 23 3 5 = true := by
  decide
```

The first says 27 reaches 1 within 111 steps. The second says 28 is even and at
least 4, that 5 + 23 = 28, and that both summands are prime — each verified
against a trial-division bound the exporter supplies, so the kernel checks one
multiplication instead of computing a square root. `isPrime_of_isPrimeWithBound`
proves once that such a bound really does establish primality.

**These are finite checks, not evidence.** 500 certificates are 500 bounded
facts. None states or implies Collatz or Goldbach, and a passing build says
nothing about either conjecture.

Every proof closes with `decide`, so the Lean **kernel** checks it.
`native_decide` is barred: it evaluates via compiled native code and trusts the
result through `Lean.ofReduceBool` and `Lean.trustCompiler`, which would widen
the trusted base to the compiler and runtime. `ProofX/Audit.lean` enforces this
during `lake build` by walking each theorem's real axiom dependencies — a
textual scan cannot see an axiom introduced by a tactic.

```bash
lake build                                  # kernel-check + axiom audit
python -m codebase.cli export lean          # regenerate from the ledger
python -m codebase.cli export lean --check  # fail if they drifted
```

See [docs/lean4.md](docs/lean4.md) for the formal boundary and acceptance bar.

## Near-Miss Scoring

Both falsifiers reduce a candidate to a ranking score in `[0, 1]`.

```text
Collatz:  near_miss = 0.70 * risk_score + 0.30 * excursion_bonus
Goldbach: near_miss = 0.85 * deficit    + 0.15 * structural_hardness
```

These are ranking functions, not proof certificates. They decide what the
search inspects first and what the report surfaces. If a weight changes, the
corresponding derivation in [docs/engines/falsification.md](docs/engines/falsification.md)
must change with it.

## Reproducibility

Engine randomness flows through a seeded NumPy generator. Child seeds are
derived deterministically so that a target-specific run can be compared with a
combined run at the same master seed.

```python
rng_master = np.random.default_rng(seed)
collatz_seed, goldbach_seed = rng_master.integers(0, 2**31, size=2)
```

Every evaluated candidate can be written to JSONL:

```json
{
  "candidate": 12345,
  "conjecture": "collatz",
  "strategy": "inverse_tree_beam_search",
  "features": {
    "lyapunov_exponent": 0.0412,
    "hurst_exponent": 0.5831,
    "parity_ratio": 0.5714
  },
  "near_miss_score": 0.2847,
  "rng_seed": 1234567890
}
```

Reproducibility depends on the Python version, dependency versions, platform
math libraries, and code revision. Keep the command, seed, dependency lockfile,
and ledger together when publishing results.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammedAlkindi/ProofX.git
cd ProofX

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -e .

python -m codebase.cli falsify --budget 200 --seed 42 --target both
```

## Research Workflow

```bash
# 1. Run a directed search and save the full ledger.
python -m codebase.cli falsify \
    --budget 2000 --seed 42 --target both \
    --save-ledger results/ledger.jsonl \
    --output-json results/summary.json

# 2. Inspect the ledger in the static viewer.
open src/ledger-viewer.html

# 3. Hand-label entries, then fit a calibrator.
python -m codebase.cli calibrate fit \
    --ledger results/ledger_labelled.jsonl \
    --method isotonic \
    --output results/calibrator.pkl

# 4. Annotate a ledger with calibrated scores.
python -m codebase.cli calibrate annotate \
    --ledger results/ledger.jsonl \
    --calibrator results/calibrator.pkl

# 5. Compare near-miss neighborhoods across engines.
python -m codebase.cli correlate \
    --collatz results/collatz.jsonl \
    --goldbach results/goldbach.jsonl \
    --radius 200

# 6. Export certifiable rows as Lean theorems and kernel-check them.
python -m codebase.cli export lean --ledger results/ledger.jsonl
lake build
```

## Testing

The repository policy expects these checks before a commit:

```bash
pytest
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy packages/python/codebase
lake build
npm install
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/validate-links.sh
```

The badges describe the intended quality floor, not a mathematical guarantee.
If a check is failing, note that explicitly in any published result or release.
