## 2025-04-27 — Hardy-Littlewood deficit search added

**What changed:** `FalsificationEngine.py` integrated Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture B as a deficit oracle. Searches even numbers whose actual partition count G(n) falls furthest below prediction.

**H-L formula:**
```
G(n) ≈ 2·C₂ · ∏_{p|n, p≥3} (p−1)/(p−2) · n / (log n)²
C₂ = 0.6601618158 (twin prime constant)
```

**Sparse candidate families tested:**
| Family | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Powers of 2 (2^k) | Fewest odd prime factors → smallest correction product |
| 2·p (large prime p) | Single odd prime factor; correction (p−1)/(p−2) → 1 slowly |
| n ≡ 2 (mod 30) | Avoids small primes 3, 5; structurally harder for partitions |
| n ≡ 2 (mod 6) | Avoids factor of 3; complement class to mod-30 |

**Blended score:** `0.85 × deficit + 0.15 × structural_hardness`

**Top candidate (seed 42):** n = 2 × 10^17 + 2, deficit score 0.3944. All candidates verified to have ≥ 1 decomposition.

**Result:** No counterexample found in tested range up to 10^18.

> **Scale caveat, added 2026-08-13.** The methodology above matches the current
> engine, but the top-candidate and "up to 10^18" figures predate it and have
> no surviving ledger; current candidate generation caps at n ≤ 10^5
> (`_generate_sparse_candidates`). Treat the figures as illustrative output.

## 2025-04-01 — Initial linear scan

> **Marked unverified 2026-08-13.** No run ledger, command, code revision, or
> hardware context for this entry exists in this repository — at the stated
> 200M numbers/sec, scanning the 5 × 10^17 even numbers below 10^18 is roughly
> 79 machine-years. Per docs/research-standards.md, treat this entry as
> illustrative output, not a tested range.

**Tested range:** 4 to 10^18 (step 2, even numbers only)
**Throughput:** 200M+ numbers/sec
**Method:** Sieve of Eratosthenes + partition enumeration
**Result:** Every even number tested admits at least one prime pair decomposition.

## Next targets

- Extend deficit search to n up to 10^20 using distributed Workers
- Add Ternary Goldbach cross-check (every odd n > 5 = p + p + p) as correlation study
- Publish top-100 near-miss ledger to GitHub as open data
