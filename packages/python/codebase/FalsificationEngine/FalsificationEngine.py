═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Directed counterexample search for the Collatz and Goldbach conjectures.

Design philosophy
─────────────────
Uniform (brute-force) scanning wastes compute on numbers that trivially satisfy
each conjecture.  This engine applies two principled strategies:

  Collatz  — Inverse-tree beam search.  We expand backward from seeds with
             known anomalous stopping times, following the exact inverse Collatz
             map.  Any number that reaches a dangerous seed inherits its risky
             suffix; the feature vector from Analytics.py quantifies that risk
             as a continuous score.

  Goldbach — Hardy-Littlewood deficit search.  Conjecture B (H-L) predicts the
             expected partition count G(n).  We search even numbers whose actual
             G(n) falls furthest below that prediction — the numbers structurally
             closest to having NO partition (i.e., a counterexample).

Reproducibility guarantee: all randomness flows through a single seeded
np.random.Generator; given seed s, the search path is identical across runs.

    Algorithm
    ─────────
    1. Precompute primes up to _SIEVE_LIMIT once.
    2. Generate candidates from "structurally sparse" families (see below).
    3. For each candidate, compute actual G(n) and Hardy-Littlewood G̃(n).
    4. Score by deficit: near_miss = 1 - G(n)/G̃(n).
    5. Apply algebraic filters from AlgebraicExtensions.py to compute a
       "structural hardness" bonus that boosts candidates with few allowed
       residue classes.
    6. Record to ledger.

    Sparse candidate families (decreasing expected partition count):
      A. Powers of 2: n = 2^k — no odd prime factors ⟹ empty Euler product,
         minimal singular-series correction.
      B. n = 2·p for large prime p — the single factor (p-1)/(p-2) → 1 as p → ∞.
      C. n ≡ 2 (mod 6): not divisible by 3, missing the (3-1)/(3-2) = 2× boost.
      D. n ≡ 2 (mod 30): not divisible by 3 or 5, missing both boosts.

    Why deficit, not absolute partition count?
    G(n) grows roughly as n/(log n)², so comparing raw counts across scales is
    misleading.  The deficit measures how anomalous n is RELATIVE TO ITS SCALE.
